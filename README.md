# Hydrogen-Air-Mixer

This project on hydrogen-air mixers features:
- Integration of ANSYS Fluent in a Python environment by means of PyFluent
- Genetic Algorithm optimization to determine the Reynolds for most uniform mixing (with PyGAD)

This repository contains:
- The already meshed geometry of the mixer
- The complete optimization code

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use pip to install all libraries
    - ansys.fluent.core
    - sys
    - io
    - numpy
    - pygad
2. Download the mesh and copy the path
3. Insert path on mesh import line in the code
4. Adjust parameters in GA class
5. Run the algorithm
